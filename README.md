# stellar_structure
Solution to the stellar structure equations for a static compact object in GR given real tabulated dense matter equations of state.
# Content
The [Stellar_structure_manual notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DavidRamosSal/stellar_structure/blob/master/Static_structure_manual.ipynb) gives an in-depth description and validation of the integration routine created to solve the system of ODE's.

The [RAnalysis notebook](...) uses the modularized version of the routine to analyze the physical acceptability of the stellar models obtained with 38 dense matter EOSs. 
 
<!--The following calculations can be found in the [stellar_structure_manual notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DavidRamosSal/stellar_structure/blob/master/Static_structure_manual.ipynb):
* Interpolation of EOS
* Numerical solution to the TOV equations
* Numerical derivatives of density and pressure profiles
* M-R and M-rho_c diagrams

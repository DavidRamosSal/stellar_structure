# stellar_structure
Solution to the structure equations on GR given real tabulated dense matter equations of state.
# Content
The following calculations are done in the Static_structure notebook:
* Interpolation of EOS
* Numerical solution to the TOV equations
* Numerical derivatives of density and pressure profiles
* M-R and M-rho_c diagrams

Extra material and ongoing calculations can be found in the older notebooks folder.
